            <span class="text">Research project focused on exploring the versatility of 3D printing in creating prismatic truss elements for potential medical applications. This is achieved through a comparative analysis of the compressive strength of various common three-dimensional truss configurations. Models are 3D printed and subsequently subjected to destructive testing using an Instron machine.</span>

            <span class="text">In recent years, an increasing number of surgical procedures are now using metal trusses to correct certain bone conditions. For example, a potential practical application of our experiment is 3D printed spinal implants. A study was recently done using 3D printed titanium spinal implants with truss-and-strut-based open architecture, which promotes bone in-growth while supporting optimal load bearing.</span>

            <span class="text">The Bernoulli-Euler beam theory is a model describing how beams behave under axial forces and bending. The two primary assumptions made by the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory are that 'plane sections remain plane' and that deformed beam angles (slopes) are small. In this problem, a 2D Bernoulli-Euler beam, supported by a roller and a pin (statically determinate), is subjected to a distributed load of 2 kips/ft over its entire length.</span>
            <span class="text">Three different mesh resolutions are used for the analysis. The beam is assigned specific boundary conditions to ensure it is determinate and stable, and it will be subjected to an external load. Finally, hand calculations will be performed to verify the computed analysis. In the second part of the problem, there will be a discussion and comparison of the results of the analysis based on the three different mesh resolutions.</span>

            <span class="text">The scope of this project encompasses the design of a ten-story mixed-use art center to be located at 35 E 4 St, New York, NY 10003. Cooper JAHM Design, LLC have performed the architectural, structural, geotechnical, and drainage design for the proposed building. Architectural design and preliminary structural design were done in the Fall 2021 semester.</span>
            <span class="text">Detailed structural, geotechnical, and drainage design were completed during the Spring 2022 semester. All design work includes calculations and drawings, as appropriate, and can be found in this report and the associated drawings set. The proposed building will feature studios and gallery   spaces, with a cafe on the first floor, an accessible green roof on the sixth floor, a full-floor gallery on the tenth, and a non-accessible green roof on top of the tenth floor. The full height of the building will be 155 feet. The building will have a total of 62,200 square feet of floor area, supported by a framework of concrete beams on a concrete foundation.</span>
