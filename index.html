                <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Juan Esteban, a recent civil engineering graduate who was born in Bogotá, Colombia and came to the US to complete my undergraduate studies in engineering. For the last couple of years, I have lived in New York City, which is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse cities in the world.</p>
                <p>I served as a teaching assistant for two upper-level classes: Water Resources Engineering and Fluid Mechanics and Flow Systems. This experience fostered my enthusiasm for both research and teaching. I completed my undergraduate studies at The Cooper Union, where I was fortunate to be surrounded by an incredible group of professors and students.</p>

                <h2 class="title">Research Interests</h2>
                <p>My research interest centers in using machine learning to improve civil engineering design processes, particularly in optimizing conventional steel and concrete member design. I hope to create practical tools that make these designs more efficient by using machine learning algorithms and large data sets.</p>
                <p>Also, I’m interested in the behavior of materials and their response to imposing large deformations, by applying dynamic and non dynamic loading conditions.</p>
